# EnvironmentHealthPredictor
A novel machine learning approach for comprehensive environmental health assessment by combining air and water quality metrics. This project implements a stacking ensemble model that provides holistic environmental quality classifications to support sustainable urban development.

**Overview**
This project addresses the growing challenge of environmental degradation in urban areas by developing an integrated machine learning model that:

Combines air and water quality data to provide comprehensive environmental health assessments
Achieves 99% accuracy in classifying environmental conditions
Identifies key contributing factors to environmental degradation
Supports data-driven decision making for environmental policy and interventions
